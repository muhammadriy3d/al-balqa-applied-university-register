# CLONE: Al-Balqa Applied University Registeration System

I decide to recreate the balqa register system because I didn't like it so much I want to keep the style approach the same but changing UX so the students can register and do their stuff at ease.

## NOTES

- Most importantly I want to let the system more accessible to all people!
- THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL OR ANY ORIGIN FILE FROM THE REAL SYSTEM, THIS ONLY MY OWN PRESPECTIVE FOR VERY LITTLE ENCHANCE.
