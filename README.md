# CLONE: Al-Balqa Applied University Registeration System

I decide to recreate the balqa register system because I didn't like it so much I want to keep the style approach the same but changing UX so the students can register and do their stuff at ease.

## NOTES

- Most importantly I want to let the system more accessible to all people!
- THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL OR ANY ORIGIN FILE FROM THE REAL SYSTEM, THIS ONLY MY CLONE FOR VERY LITTLE IMPROVEMENT FOR THE SEEK OF LEARNING AND DOING REAL WORLD PROBLEMS, THIS IS NOT RELATED TO IT IN ANY FORM.
- IF YOU ARE THE OWNER AND YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT YOU CAN ASK FOR DELETE. NO PROBLEM!
